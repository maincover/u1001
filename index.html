<br>The <strong>“Robustness and Evolvability of Life”</strong>, jointly funded by <a href="http://www.inserm.fr/">INSERM (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)</a> <add link> and <a href="https://www.univ-paris5.fr/">Paris Descartes University</a>   is composed of two research teams: “Avoidance and Repair of Biological Damage” and “Systems Engineering and Evolution Dynamics”. The laboratory is located in the Paris Descartes Medical Faculty building at the center of Paris. </br>

<br> In the spirit of the Japanese proverb <em><strong>“None of us alone is more intelligent than all of us together”</em></strong>, our laboratory’s mission is to promote multidisciplinary research in Life Sciences by bringing together collaborators from disciplines as diverse as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Evolution, Genetics, Microbiology, and Medicine. Such a blend of varied expertise has allowed us to tackle several ambitious topics: </br>

        <ul class="bigFont">
                <li>Causes and consequences of variability during DNA, RNA and protein synthesis</li>
                <li>Ecology and Evolution of bacteria and their viruses and hosts</li>
                <li>Systems and Synthetic Biology</li>
        </ul>
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
<br>We focus on both fundamental research as well as their medical implications (infectious diseases, cancer, aging). </br>

<br>Laboratory members are also involved in a variety of teaching and promotion of science activities including the creation of the <a href="http://www.medils.org/"> MedILS (Mediterranean Institute for Life Sciences)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cri-paris.org/">CRI (Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity)</a>, which harbors undergraduate, master and PhD programs as well as outreach and citizen science activities. </br>
