Hi all,

Here a link to [The Biomedical & Life Sciences Collection](https://hstalks.com/t/2938/evolutionary-tradeoffs-and-the-geometry-of-gene-ex/?biosci). Which has a large (very high quality) list of lectures given by scientists. But protected by a password.

A bird told me a password so here it is:

Username: DKFZ Password: (check in your mail) 

Best,

Alvaro

Hi all,

Just reminder, we have 2 lab-linkers:

* for oligo: commande d'amorces

* for gblocks and genes:  gBlocks, genes, produits NGS ,Ultramers, CRISPR , sondes qPCR (autres que FAM-zen-IBFQ), DsiRNA 

Be careful to use the good lablinker during the checkout. You can not mix gene and primer in the same order.

Thank you,

Chantal

<s>Hi all,

The "Préfecture de Police" will come for a security visit on the 26th of January afternoon  (14:00):   see email below.

No big experiment during this  time because of possible cut of power and fire exercise.
