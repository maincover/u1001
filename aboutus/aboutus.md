History
=======

**Ta Ma Ra**’s friendship started in the spring of 1991, when ,two young PhD students Ivan and François joined Miro Radman's lab on the scientific campus of the Institut Jacques Monod in Jussieu (Paris, France). Miro Radman's scientific life had already a rich history (clik on pre-TaMaRa history) including the discovery of the SOS response, the mechanisms of mismatch repair and the molecular nature of the species barrier.


The lab was relatively small (10-15 people very dynamic people) and poor but they had great fun and their work (evolution of mutators, barriers to horizontal transfer in bacteria, errors in RNA) was well published, attracting interest from the scientitic community at large and even more importantly from young students, colleagues and post-docs. Most of these belonged to the " mutator network " which included 7 labs from 7 different disciplines and which met on a regular basis to exchange ideas and data about the role played by mutator in bacterial evolution (and related topics such as pathogenesis and the emergence of antibiotic resistance) .


After 9 years spent together in Jussieu, which included the PhD of Ivan and François in 1995, Ta Ma Ra’s lab was created in the Necker Children's Hospital Medical School in Paris where it doubled in space and number of people and receive enough funding to start completely new projects. Convinced of the use of Escherichia coli that brought so much to science and so much fun to us, we decided to increase even further the importance of it's genetic analysis by using generic technologies such as fluorescent microscopy that could be applied to investigate many different basic questions about sex, life and death of this model bacteria on an individual basis.

To apply for position in the lab, the standard procedure is:
1. An initial contact by e-mail to describe your interests and motivations
2. To send recommendation letters (from your supervisor or someone that worked with you and at least one outsider who knows you personally and scientifically)
3. To come and spend a couple of days with us in Paris (travel and hotel would be reimbursed) where you would give a seminar and exchange ideas with lab members. This could enable us to decide what type of project might be worked on together.
