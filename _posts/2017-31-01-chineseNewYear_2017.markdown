# Chinese New Year 2017

Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival in China, is China's most important traditional festival. It is also the most important celebration for families, and a week of official public holiday.

The Date of Chinese New Year Is NOT January 1st...
Chinese New Year 2017 is on Saturday January 28. 

In 2017, China's Spring Festival public holiday is from January 27 to February 2. 

## Chinese New Year 2017 — a Rooster Year

2017 is a year of the Rooster according to the Chinese 12-year animal zodiac cycle. Other Rooster years include: …1921, 1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017… If you were born then you’re a Rooster. Each Chinese zodiac year begins on Chinese New Year's Day.

Rooster years are believed to be the most unlucky for people born in a year of the Rooster. 

## Why Do People Celebrate Chinese New Year?

Although there are many interesting legends and stories explaining the start of the Chinese New Year festival, the main two reasons for the festival are:

* To celebrate a year of hard work, have a good rest, and relax with family
* To wish for a lucky and prosperous coming year

Chinese people believe that a good start to the year will lead to a lucky year. Chinese traditionally celebrated the start of a new year of farm work, and wished for a good harvest (when most were farmers). This has now evolved to celebrating the start of a new business year and wishing for profits and success in various vocations.
